## topics

    In this repository are open sourced my bookmarks (almost all of them, with some extra stuff) for my [xxx-days-of-code](https://github.com/max-devjs/xxx-days-of-code) journey (right, I have six months of pushes to do), divided by topics.

    Note:

    - topic:  a single collection of bookmarks for a specific ... topic
    - topics: set of ... topics
    - this repo will be updated more or less on a daily basis
    - some topics are still a mess
    - some topics will continue a mess
    - some things can be added, deleted, updated etc without warning
    - I did not and probably I will not read/check every bookmark for every and each topic: this is mainly a set of collected articles of "it seems to be interesting" things
    - most important, probably a good deal of the links will be obsolete in the near future

    Anyway, feel free
    
    - to check if you find useful links in the topics
    - to suggest useful links (and topics)
